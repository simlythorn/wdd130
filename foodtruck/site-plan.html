      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our mission is to bring higher quality Cambodian cuisine to Tacoma, Washington. This website will help customers find this high quality
      Cambodian cuisine with easy-to-navigate introduction, menu with descriptions and prices, location, and hours of operation information. We will also have links to social
      media pages and many ways to contact us via e-mail, telephone, and social media. Because I am learning to become a website developer, I will also make 
      a shopping platform with a cart so customers can order and pay online. This will update to my food truck so I will see the online orders immediately and make the food
      at the right time. We would like to have a good style for our food truck and have our employees dressed in a fun, attractive manner. We want to drive to special events
      to share our food and attract more customers to our brick and mortar loactions. Most importantly, we want to share the wonderful taste of healthy Khmer food at prices 
      that always bring our customers back for more.  
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>For all people who live in Tacoma, both Cambodian people or other, who enjoy original Khmer traditional food. Some of them miss the traditional tastes or want to try
        something new. We want it to be easy and affordable for those who have a busy life with work and donâ€™t have much time to cook.
